                <p>Donating blood plasma is a safe process that has been used since the early 20th century to help save lives. Thousands of people safely and painlessly donate every day. Blood plasma donation is performed in a highly controlled environment by professionally trained medical staff using sterile, one-time-use, disposable materials. Facilities follow strict guidelines when collecting plasma to ensure the donor’s safety and comfort.</p>

                <p>“The Fight is in Us” is an initiative to maximize the individual and societal benefit of COVID-19 plasma. The campaign will focus on recruiting COVID-19 survivors to donate their plasma at licensed blood and plasma collection centers. The campaign will begin in the United States, and then expand to Europe.</p>
                <p>This is an united effort bringing together several coalitions and organizations leading academic medical institutions (the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project and affiliates including Expanded Access to Plasma coalition led by Mayo Clinic, Michigan State University, Washington University of St. Louis); leading plasma companies (Grifols and the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance including those announced at its inception—Biotest, BPL, CSL Behring, LFB, Octapharma, and Takeda—and new members ADMA Biologics, BioPharma Plasma, GC Pharma, and Sanquin; and leading blood centers (including the AABB, Blood Centers of America and America’s Blood Centers); COVID-19 survivor groups including Survivor Corps.</p>

                <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
                <p>MITRE respects the privacy of its website visitors.  This Privacy Policy explains the types of information collected from site visitors, and how MITRE uses that information. The use of the MITRE website constitutes acceptance of this policy.</p>
                <h2>Information Collected from Web Traffic Reporting Tools</h2>
                <p>When a visitor visits the MITRE website, the website server logs basic information about each visit. MITRE processes this information monthly via an automated software tool to identify any site performance issues, popular sections and content, and other important site characteristics. This information does not identify you personally. This information is used only as a source of anonymous statistical information. MITRE may store such information ourselves, or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by our service providers.</p>
                <p>MITRE employs cookies for collecting portions of this information. "Cookies" are data that may be sent to your web browser and stored on your computer. Most web browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, or to notify you if a cookie is sent to you. If you wish not to have cookies set during your visit to this MITRE managed website, you can disable them in your web browser. The raw log data is retained for a minimum of ninety (90) days.</p>
                <p>MITRE also uses a free third-party software service called Google Analytics® to capture and analyze website usage information. This service supplies us with additional non-personally identifiable information about MITRE's website users to help us create content that our users may find useful. Visitors that wish to have their non-personally identifiable information not collected by means of their visit to the MITRE website have the option to opt-out of the Google Analytics tracking service via this link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.</p>
                <h2>Information Collected on the Inquiry Form</h2>
                <p>When a visitor answers the non-personally identifiable questions on the Inquiry Form, the answers are processed by a software as a service Bot (“Bot”) developed by the healthcare research team at the Microsoft Corporation®.  The non-personally identifiable answers are securely stored on a Microsoft Azure ® commercial cloud tenant that is hosted and operated by MITRE.  MITRE’s use of the Microsoft Bot does not imply an endorsement and/or sponsorship of any specific company’s service, product, or enterprise.</p>
                <h2>Information Collected from E-mail and Web Forms</h2>
                <p>Visitors may contact MITRE by postal mail or electronically, using information found on the Contact Us page. MITRE may share the information that you provide to us via e-mail within the corporation to respond to your queries, but we do not provide information to anyone outside of the corporation unless required by law to do so. We will never share your information with a third party for any commercial purpose.</p>
                <h2>Information Collected from Third-Party Software</h2>
                <p>When visitors visit this MITRE managed website, visitors may be presented with links to third-party websites.  When a visitor clinks on that third-party website link the visitor may be subject to third-party software. MITRE does not collect any information that may be collected by that third-party; however, information you supply to that third-party software may be collected and/or used by that party. For information about that third-party's Privacy Policy, please see their respective website(s).</p>
                <h2>Information Collected from Smartphone Applications</h2>
                <p>MITRE does not collect any information that may be collected by a smartphone application; however, information you supply to that smartphone application may be collected by that party. For information about that third party's Privacy Policy, please see their respective website(s).</p>
                <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>The MITRE website may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, MITRE reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice.
